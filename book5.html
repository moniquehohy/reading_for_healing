 <h5 class="card-title">Editors Review</h5>
 <p class="card-text">Black Beauty is a renowned classic with many levels making it as enjoyable read for me now as it was as a bedtime story when I was a child. Beautifully written Black Beauty contains some rather grown up truths about the real world and the abuse animals can go through, as well as exploring the ideas that they can love and feel just as much as we can. For me, this was fascinating and really taught me the principles of respecting all creatures. To this day I still cry at many scenes throughout the book (and movie) but for me that’s one of the wonderful things about it – it can take me back to when pain is pain and happiness is happiness without all of the history or complications of real life.  </p>
